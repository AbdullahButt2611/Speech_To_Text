The "Speech to Text Converter" repository contains code related to a project that allows users to convert spoken words into text. This repository offers a valuable resource for developers who are interested in building their own speech-to-text conversion applications.
<br><br>
The code in the repository is written in a variety of programming languages, including Python and JavaScript, and uses a range of tools and libraries to perform the speech-to-text conversion. Some of the tools and libraries used include the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, the Web Speech API, and the SpeechRecognition library.
<br><br>
The code in the repository is well-organized and documented, making it easy for developers to understand and customize. The code also includes best practices for handling user input and managing errors, ensuring that the application is robust and user-friendly.
